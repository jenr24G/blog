# On-Chain Voting Results for [MIPs](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/MIPs)

> [Granola Systems](https://granola.team/) is a software consultancy and Mina ecosystem partner. We make winning teams using our expertise in leadership, DevOps, Web3, distributed systems, functional programming, and data engineering. Granola has developed a dashboard for displaying on-chain [voting results](https://www.mina.vote). We operate an archive node and do regular [staking ledger dumps](https://github.com/Granola-Team/mina-ledger/tree/main/mainnet).

This article details the calculation of Mina's on-chain voting results. Equipped with the tools and knowledge, you can independently verify our code, logic, and results. Public blockchains like Mina Protocol are truly remarkable and equally as complex! We always strive for correctness in our code and exhaustively test.

All the code for this project is open source ❤️ and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Granola-Team/mina-on-chain-voting).

## Results Calculation Instructions

We calculate the results of [MIP3](https://mina.vote/proposal/3/results) and [MIP4](https://mina.vote/proposal/4/results) voting

- MIP3 Start: *5/20/23 at 6:00 AM UTC* (Epoch 53, Slot 2820)
- MIP3 End: *5/28/23 at 6:00 AM UTC* (Epoch 53, slot 6660)

- MIP4 Start: *5/20/23 at 6:00 AM UTC* (Epoch 53, Slot 2820)
- MIP4 End: *5/28/23 at 6:00 AM UTC* (Epoch 53, slot 6660)


| Data | Value |
|:-:|:-:|
| *Epoch* | `53` |
| *Keyword* | `MIP3, MIP4` |
| *Start time* | `May 20, 2023 06:00 UTC` |
| *End time* | `May 28, 2023 06:00 UTC` |

## Calculation steps

### Obtain staking ledger

Since we are calculating the results for MIP3 and MIP4 voting (epoch 53), we need the *next staking ledger* of the *next* epoch, i.e. the *staking ledger* of epoch 55.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    If you are not running a daemon locally, you will first need the ledger <i>hash</i>. Use the query

<pre><code>
query NextLedgerHash {
  blocks(query: {canonical: true, protocolState: {consensusState: {epoch: 54}}}, limit: 1) {
    protocolState {
      consensusState {
        nextEpochData {
          ledger {
            hash
          }
        }
        epoch
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
response = {
  "data": {
    "blocks": [
      {
        "protocolState": {
          "consensusState": {
            "epoch": 54,
            "nextEpochData": {
              "ledger": {
                "hash": "jw8dXuUqXVgd6NvmpryGmFLnRv1176oozHAro8gMFwj8yuvhBeS"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

Extract the value corresponding to the deeply nested <code>hash</code> key

<pre><code>
response['data']['blocks'][0]['protocolState']['consensusState']['nextEpochData']['ledger']['hash']
</code></pre>

</li>
<li>
  Now that we have the appropriate ledger hash, we can acquire the corresponding staking ledger, in fact, the <i>next staking ledger</i> of epoch 54, via

<pre><code>
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Granola-Team/mina-ledger/main/mainnet/jw8dXuUqXVgd6NvmpryGmFLnRv1176oozHAro8gMFwj8yuvhBeS.json -O path/to/ledger.json
</code></pre>

You can use any of the following sources (extra credit: use them all and check diffs)
<ol type="i">
  <li>
    <a href="https://docs.minaexplorer.com/minaexplorer/data-archive">
      Mina Explorer’s data archive
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/zkvalidator/mina-graphql-rs/blob/main/data/epochs/">
      Zk Validator's mina-graphql-rs repo
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Granola-Team/mina-ledger/tree/main/mainnet">
      Granola’s mina-ledger repo
    </a>
  </li>
<li>
  If you’re running a local daemon, you can export the next staking ledger (while we are in epoch 54) by

<pre><code>
mina ledger export next-staking-ledger > path/to/ledger.json
</code></pre>

and confirm the hash using

<pre><code>
mina ledger hash --ledger-file path/to/ledger.json
</code></pre>

This calculation may take several minutes!

</li></ol></ol>

### Aggregate voting stake

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Calculate each voter's <i>stake</i> from the staking ledger. Aggregate all delegations to each voter (by default, an account is delegated to itself)

<pre><code>
agg_stake = {}
delegators = set()

for account in ledger:
    pk = account['pk']
    dg = account['delegate']
    bal = Decimal(account['balance'])

    # pk delegates
    if pk != dg:
        delegators.add(pk)

    try:
        agg_stake[dg] += bal
    except:
        agg_stake[dg] = bal
</code></pre>

  </li>
  <li>
    Drop delegator votes

<pre><code>
for d in delegators:
    try:
        del agg_stake[d]
    except:
        pass
</code></pre>

  </li>
  <li>
    Now <code>agg_stake</code> is a Python dict containing each voter's aggregated stake
  </li>
</ol>

### Obtain and parse votes

To obtain all MIP3 and MIP4 votes, we need to get all transactions corresponding to the voting period (votes are just special transactions after all). It would be nice to be able to prefilter the transactions more and only fetch what is required, but since `memo` fields are *base58 encoded* and *any capitalization of the keyword is valid*, prefiltering will be complex and error-prone.

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Multiple data sources
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Run a local archive node
      </li>
      <li>
        Mina Explorer has
        <a href="https://docs.minaexplorer.com/minaexplorer/bigquery-public-dataset">
          BigQuery
        </a>,
        <a href="https://docs.minaexplorer.com/minaexplorer/graphql-getting-started">

        </a>, and
        <a href="https://docs.minaexplorer.com/rest-api/ref">
          REST
        </a>
        APIs
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtain the unique <i>voting transactions</i>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        A <i>vote</i> is a transaction satisfying:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <code>kind = PAYMENT</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>source = receiver</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Valid</i> <code>memo</code> field (either <code>mip3</code> or <code>no mip3</code>)
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Fetch all transactions for the voting period
        <ol>
          <li>
            To avoid our requests getting too big and potentially timing out, we will request the transactions from each block individually
          </li>
          <li>
            Block production varies over time; sometimes many blocks are produced in a slot, sometimes no blocks are produced. A priori, we do not know the exact block heights which constitute the voting period. We fetch all <i>canonical</i> block heights for the voting period, determined by the <i>start</i> and <i>end</i> times
<pre><code>
query BlockHeightsInVotingPeriod {
  blocks(query: {canonical: true, dateTime_gte: "2023-05-20T6:00:00Z", dateTime_lte: "2023-05-28T06:00:00Z"}, limit: 7140) {
    blockHeight
  }
}
</code></pre>

The max number of slots, hence blocks, in an epoch is `7140`. The response in includes block heights `253078` to `255481`

<pre><code>
{
  "data": {
    "blocks": [
      {
        "blockHeight": 255481
      },
      ...
      {
        "blockHeight": 253078
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
  For each canonical block height in the voting period, query the block’s <i>PAYMENT</i> transactions (votes are payments)

<pre><code>
query TransactionsInBlockWithHeight($blockHeight: Int!) {
  transactions(query: {blockHeight: $blockHeight, canonical: true, kind: "PAYMENT"}, sortBy: DATETIME_DESC, limit: 1000) {
    blockHeight
    memo
    nonce
    receiver {
      publicKey
    }
    source {
      publicKey
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

where `$blockHeight` is substituted with each of the voting period’s canonical block heights (automation is highly recommended). Again, we include a limit which far exceeds the number of transactions in any block so we don’t accidentally get short-changed by a default limit. This process will take several minutes if done sequentially. Performance improvements are left as an exercise to the reader.

For example, the response for block `216063`

<pre><code>
{
  "data": {
    "transactions": [
      {
        "blockHeight": 255481,
        "memo": "E4YM2vTHhWEg66xpj52JErHUBU4pZ1yageL4TVDDpTTSsv8mK6YaH",
        "nonce": 367551,
        "receiver": {
          "publicKey": "B62qjYanmV7y9njVeH5UHkz3GYBm7xKir1rAnoY4KsEYUGLMiU45FSM"
        },
        "source": {
          "publicKey": "B62qre3erTHfzQckNuibViWQGyyKwZseztqrjPZBv6SQF384Rg6ESAy"
        }
      },
      ...
      {
        "blockHeight": 255481,
        "memo": "E4YM2vTHhWEg66xpj52JErHUBU4pZ1yageL4TVDDpTTSsv8mK6YaH",
        "nonce": 105533,
        "receiver": {
          "publicKey": "B62qkiF5CTjeiuV1HSx4SpEytjiCptApsvmjiHHqkb1xpAgVuZTtR14"
        },
        "source": {
          "publicKey": "B62qoXQhp63oNsLSN9Dy7wcF3PzLmdBnnin2rTnNWLbpgF7diABciU6"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

Notice the base58 encoded `memo` field

</li>
              <li>
                Concatenate transactions for all canonical blocks in the voting period
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Filter the votes
            <ol>
              <li>
                <code>memo.lower()</code> <i>exactly equal</i> to <code>mip3</code> or <code>no mip3</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>source = receiver</code> (self transaction)
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
            <li>
              The memo field is base58 encoded
            </li>
          <li>
            If there are multiple votes associated with a single public key, only the <i>latest</i> vote is counted; <i>latest</i> being defined:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              For multiple votes from the same account across several blocks, take the vote in the highest block.
            </li>
            <li>
              For multiple votes from the same account in the same block, take the vote with the highest nonce.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Calculate weighted voting results

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Sum all aggregated voter stake to get the <i>total voting stake</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    For each delegate, start with their total stake, and subtract the balances of accounts that delegate to them with an overriding vote
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide yes/no vote stakes by the total voting stake
  </li>
</ol>

### Adjust Votes and Voting Stake with Non-Delegating Voters
Find all votes made by a delegating account, and subtract their account balance from the final voting stake if they disagree with their delegate
<pre><code>
delegating_stake = {}
delegating_votes = {}
for vote in votes:
    if vote.pk in delegators:
        delegating_stake[vote.pk] = accounts[vote.pk]['balance']
        delegating_votes[vote.pk] = vote.memo
for vote in delegating_votes
    delegate_vote = votes[accounts[pk]['delegate']]
    if against(delegate_vote) and for(vote) and pk not in delegating_votes:
        no_stake -= delegating_stake[vote.pk]
    else if for(delegate_vote) and  against(vote) and pk not in delegating_votes:
        yes_stake -= delegating_stake[vote.pk]
</code></pre>
